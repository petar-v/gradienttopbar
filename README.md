# Compatibility

For up to GNOME 43, please use [this release](https://github.com/petar-v/gradienttopbar/releases/tag/44-0). Any new features will not be backwards compatible.

For GNOME 43 and above, please use the `master` branch or the latest release.

# Issues

For any issues/bugs/problems/questions, please use the issues tab.

Beta-testing on newer releases is much appreciated as I usually use the latest GNOME version.

# To Do

- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Add box shadow settings
- [ ] Add a "Contributions" and a "Run from source" guides
- [ ] Fix an issue where "Desktop icons" extension creates a weird window that messes up the dynamic toolbar color effect.
- [ ] Add a demo video
- [ ] Figure out reliable testing methods or at least unit tests
- [ ] Make it work with something like tiling when the window occupies the whole top horizontally (to test with Tiling Assistant)
